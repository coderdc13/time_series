### ARMA Discrepancies

The image directly above is a snipped image from the starter code. In this directly image above, the the ARMA model results are given. The discrepancies in values between the starter code and the student-author's generated answers are provided below in light blue underline so as to make reading by the Instructor Grader easier.

### GARCH Discrepancies


## Regression


## Regression Discrepancies

There were at least two (2) discrepancies identified. One conflict was the difference in the X_train dataset between the starter code and the student-author generated version. The other conflict was the difference in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the starter code and the student-author generated version.

### X Train Discrepancies

![answer for X_train dataset](images/regr/answer_X_train_1218_rows.PNG)

The image directly above is a snipped image from the starter code. In this image directly above, there are 1218 entries. This set conflicts somewhat with the student author's answer that is directly below in this section and pasted.

### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)


![answer for rmse](images/regr/answer_rmse.PNG)

The image directly above is a snipped image from the starter code. The student author focuses on the two values for Out-of-Sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for In-Sample RMSE. These values conflict somewhat with the student author's answer that is directly below and pasted.
