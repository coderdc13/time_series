# General Introduction


## Time Series


### ARMA

It could be stated that the model does not fit the data.

### ARIMA

Again, as for ARMA, for ARIMA, it could be stated that the model does not fit the data.

### GARCH

### Questions

Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
## Time Series Discrepancies

### ARMA Discrepancies

![answer for ARMA](images/ts/arma_answer.PNG)

The image directly above is a snipped image from the starter code. In this directly image above, the the ARMA model results are given. The discrepancies in values between the starter code and the student-author's generated answers are provided below in light blue underline so as to make reading by the Instructor Grader easier.

The discrepancies in values between the starter code and the student-author's generated answers are provided below in light blue underline so as to make reading by the Instructor Grader easier.

### GARCH Discrepancies

Besides the discrepancies in date of execution of test (underlined in blue), the student-author could find no other discrepancies between the starter code answer key and the student-author's generated answers.

## Regression


### Root Mean Squred Error (RMSE)


![student generated rmse](images/regr/student_rmse.PNG)


The homework readme file stated that "Out-of-sample data is data that the model hasn't seen before (Testing Data)." Also, the homework readme file stated that "In-sample data is data that the model was trained on (Training Data)." 


## Regression Discrepancies

There were at least two (2) discrepancies identified. One conflict was the difference in the X_train dataset between the starter code and the student-author generated version. The other conflict was the difference in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the starter code and the student-author generated version.

### X Train Discrepancies

![answer for X_train dataset](images/regr/answer_X_train_1218_rows.PNG)

The image directly above is a snipped image from the starter code. In this image directly above, there are 1218 entries. This set conflicts somewhat with the student author's answer that is directly below in this section and pasted.

### Discrepancies for Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)


![answer for rmse](images/regr/answer_rmse.PNG)

The image directly above is a snipped image from the starter code. The student author focuses on the two values for Out-of-Sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for In-Sample RMSE. These values conflict somewhat with the student author's answer that is directly below and pasted.
